This is the main function of this program. It will demonstrate the whole process of TMDPDF analysis.

The main steps are:
1. g.s. fit
2. renormalization
3. extrapolation in the coordinate space and FT
4. matching
5. large Pz and physical pion mass extrapolation
6. combine the gamma t and gamma z to get the final result
